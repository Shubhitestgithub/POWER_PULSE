**Overview**

Effective energy management is essential in today's world for both households and utility companies. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict household power consumption using historical data. The model provides actionable insights into usage patterns and helps forecast energy demand, contributing to smarter energy planning and sustainability.

**Objectives**

\- Predict household energy usage with high accuracy.  
\- Identify trends and patterns in energy consumption.  
\- Provide visual insights for decision-making.  
\- Support further research in energy optimization.

**Methodology**

**1\. Data Exploration**  
\- Loaded dataset to analyze structure and quality.  
\- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.

**2\. Data Preprocessing**  
\- Cleaned and handled missing values.  
\- Extracted date/time features.  
\- Scaled features for model training.

**3\. Feature Engineering**  
\- Selected relevant variables for power consumption prediction.  
\- Created engineered features like daily averages and rolling statistics.

**4\. Model Development**  
\- Split data into training and testing sets.  
\- Trained multiple regression models:  
  \- Linear Regression  
  \- Random Forest  
  \- Gradient Boosting  
  \- Neural Network  
\- Tuned hyperparameters to enhance performance.

**5\. Evaluation**  
\- Assessed model performance using:  
  \- RMSE  
  \- MAE  
  \- R² Score  
\- Compared models to identify the best predictor.
